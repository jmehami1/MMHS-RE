### Implementation of the light source estimation

The github repository providing the implementation of the light source estimation is available [here](https://github.com/jmehami1/MMHS-RE).

### Mitsuba config file and dataset

We forked the first version of Mitsuba and added the hyperspectral image generation (see [here](https://github.com/jmehami1/mitsuba)). The config file for the Mitsuba scenes can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SIUlGbyHUFoWXUvZ2eydZz-lOyQSqijd?usp=sharing) .
