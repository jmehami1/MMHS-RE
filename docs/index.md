## Supplementary materials for "Multi-modal Non-Isotropic Light Source Modelling for Reflectance Estimation in Hyperspectral Imaging "

This page contains dataset and supplementary materials for the paper. We will release the implementation after the publication of our paper

### Mitsuba config file and dataset

We forked the first version of Mitsuba and added the hyperspectral image generation (see [here](https://github.com/jmehami1/mitsuba)). The config file for the mitsuba simulator can be downloaded [here]() and the produced images are available [here]().
